This Repository hosts all 3D files for the EduGrid Learning Kit project.

All files are constructed in Autodesk Inventor and the assembly is exported as a STEP file inside each 3DPrint folder.
Additionally, each assembly is also stored as a PrusaSlicer 3mf project for your convenience.

The files are also hosted on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/maxhock/designs).
